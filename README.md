# Jets

The title of this week's project is Jets. For this project I created a menu that would be visible to the user. In the menu there were 5 options:
1. List Jets
2. List Fastest Jet
3. List Longest Range Jet
4. Add a Jet
5. Exit

I created a Jet class that contained all the details such as the model, speed, price, and range. I stored and created the jets in my Hangar2 class because I messed up in my first Hangar class. When a user selects option 1 they see a printed list of jets. This was created using a For loop. When the user selects option 2, they see the specifications of the Jet with the fastest speed come up. When the user selects option 3, they see the specifications of the Jet with the longest range come up.  When the user selects option 4, they are prompted to enter the model, speed in mph, the range in miles, and the price in millions of a jet. The information they enter is used to create a jet and add it to my array of jets. When the user selects option 5, they are asked whether they are sure they want to continue or not. If they say yes, then the program exits.
